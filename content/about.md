## How to read this blog

I read posts in (up to) three waves, and my posts will generally be written to
facilitate that type of reading.

1. A rapid scroll-through looking at **titles and graphs**,
2. If I want to know more, I **read the text**, or just the sections that are interesting,
3. If I want to know more, I **read the code** for the technical details.

This means that the plots should tell the whole story on their own, the text
will provide deeper interpretation, and the code and comments walk through the
technical details.
